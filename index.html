	<div class="story" id="page1">in the beginning, there was a dog named jack. he saw the blue void all around him, <br/>and wiggled his tail, a thousand table appeared.<br/>he broke off two legs from each table and shaped them into a thousand chairs.<br/>he then broke off one leg from each chair and shaped them into a thousand vases.<br/>finally, he grabs a color furthest from the blue off the tables, <br/>he squeezed and rolled and squeezed and rolled the <span class="linkk" id="link1">chunk of color</span> for 100 days </div>
	
	<div class="story" id="page2">
		<input type="text" name="input" placeholder="jack said to name yourself.">
		<button>so you named yourself.</button>
	</div>
	
	<div class="story" id="page3">you felt disoranted and overwhelmed. 
		<br/>so you screamed and you ran and you knocked over the tables and the chairs and the vases. 
		<br/>jack looked the mess. 
		<br/>he said: i condemn you to carry and move the tables and the chairs and the vases. he then created 
		<span class="linkk linkTableRoom">a room of tables</span>, 
		<span class="linkk linkChairRoom">a room of chairs</span>, and 
		<span class="linkk linkVaseRoom">a room of vases</span>. you cried out so loud that the blue turned darker. 
		<br/>so jack created a 
		<span class="rules" id="spacebar">space bar
			<div class="showup" id="spacedirection"><p>space bar: when the player is on top of the item you can pick up the item with the space bar, the item will then be dropped into the inventory. When the player is on top of an empty space, player can dropped the item inside the inventory with the space bar. When the inventory has an item, player can only drop the item before she can pick up the next item.</p></div>
		</span> to help you pick things up, 
		<span class="rules" id="arrows">four arraows
			<div class="showup" id="arrowdirection"><p>&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;arrow keys: player can navigate with the arrow keys. click a room to start the game!!&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;</p></div>
		</span> to lead your way, and a key that says  
		<span class="rules" id="enterkey">enter
			<div class="showup" id="enterdirection"><p>return: player can go into the next room with reutrn key. player can only travle through rooms in one direction. think of the rooms as if they are connected in a circle.</p></div>
		</span>.
		<br/> jack finally said: you will do this for eternity. off you go now, little man.
