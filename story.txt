page one: 
in the beginning, jack created light. he saw the blue void all around him. 
so he snaped his finger, a thousand table appeared. 
he broke off two legs from each table and shaped them into a thousand chairs. 
he then broke off one leg from each chair and shaped them into a thousand vases. 
finally, he grabs a color furthest from the blue off the tables, 
he squeezed and rolled and squeezed and rolled the chunk of color for 100 days. (click on chunk of color)

jack said to name yourself. (the input place holder)
so you named yourself. (the button click the  button go to page three)


page three:
you felt disoranted and overwhelmed. 
so you screamed and you ran and you knocked over the tables and the chairs and the vases. 
jack looked the mess. 
he said: i condemn you to rearrange the tables and the chairs and the vases.
he then created a room of vases, a room of tables and a room of chairs. 
you cried out so loud that the blue turned darker. 
so jack created a space bar, four arraows, and a key that says enter. 
he said: you can pick things up with the space bar and enter rooms with the key, but you will do this for eternity. off you go now, little man.
